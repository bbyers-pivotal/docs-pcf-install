The following table provides recommended instance counts for a high-availability deployment:

<table border="1" class="nice">

                <th><strong>Number</strong></th>

        <tr>
                <td>Diego Cell</td>
                <td>&ge; 3</td>
                <td>The optimal balance between CPU/memory sizing and instance count depends on the performance characteristics of the apps that run on Diego cells. Scaling vertically with larger Diego cells makes for larger points of failure, and more apps go down when a cell fails. On the other hand, scaling horizontally decreases the speed at which the system rebalances apps. Rebalancing 100 cells takes longer and demands more processing overhead than rebalancing 20 cells.</td>

                <td>0 or 1</td>
                <td>For production environments, the best approach is to scale HAProxy to <code>0</code> and configure a high-availability load balancer (LB) to point directly to each Gorouter instance. You can also configure the LB to point to HAProxy scaled at <code>1</code>. Either way, an LB is the best way to host Cloud Foundry domains at a single IP address. Round-robin DNS resolution to multiple HAProxy instances has not been tested for high availability.</td>
