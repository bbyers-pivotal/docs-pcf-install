<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You need to configure this section only if you want to set up high availability for internal MySQL and have selected <strong>Internal Databases - MySQL</strong> in the <strong>Databases</strong> section.</p>


1. Select **Internal MySQL**. 

1. In the **MySQL Proxy IPs** field, enter one or more IP addresses, comma delimited, that are not in the reserved CIDR range of your network. If a MySQL node fails, these proxies re-route connections to a healthy node. See the [MySQL for PCF: Proxy](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html#proxy) topic for more information.</p>

1. (Optional) Configure round robin DNS to spread requests across your MySQL proxies. Only perform this step if you want to approximate "load balancing" on your internal MySQL proxies. 
  1. Create a DNS <code>A Record</code> to round robin against your IP addresses. For example:
	<%= image_tag("mysql-a-record.png") %>
  1. In the **MySQL Service Hostname** field, enter the hostname you created for round robin DNS. If you leave this field blank, components are configured with the IP address of the first proxy instance entered in the **MySQL Proxy IPs** field.
  <p class="note"><strong>Caution</strong>: Round robin DNS does not handle component availability as well as a load balancer. If one or more of the database proxies fail, components that rely on the MySQL database can become unavailable. At time of publication, GCP load balancers only support access to public IPs.</p>

1. Under **Automated Backups Configuration**, select **Disable mysql_backups** or **Enable mysql_backups** to enable or disable automated MySQL backups.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to enable automated MySQL backups, set the number of instances for the **Backup Prepare Node** under the **Resource Config** section of the Elastic Runtime tile to `0`.</p>

1. If you select **Enable mysql_backups**, you need a Amazon Web Services (AWS) or <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> S3-compatible blobstore. Configure your backup with the following steps:
	* For **S3 Bucket Name**, enter the name of your S3 bucket. Do not include a `s3://` prefix, a trailing `/`, or underscores. If the bucket does not already exist, it will be created automatically.
	* For **Bucket Path**, specify a folder within the bucket to hold your MySQL backups. Do not include a trailing `/`.
	* For **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**, enter your AWS or Ceph credentials.
	* For **Cron Schedule**, enter a valid cron expression to schedule your automated backups. Cron uses your machine's local time zone.

1. Click **Save**.
