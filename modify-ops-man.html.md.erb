This topic describes how to modify your Ops Manager installation by decrypting and editing the YAML files that Ops Manager uses to store configuration data. 
Operators can use these procedures to view and change values that they cannot access through the Ops Manager web interface. They can also modify the product templates that Ops Manager uses to create forms and obtain user input. 

Operators may want to modify the Ops Manager installation and product template files for a number of reasons, including the following:

* To change the User Account and Authentication (UAA) admin password of their deployment
* To retrieve key values
* To migrate content across different Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) releases

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong> Be careful when making changes to your Ops Manager installation and product template files. Use spaces instead of tabs, and remember that YAML files use whitespace as a delimiter. Finally, Pivotal does not officially support these procedures, so use them at your own risk.</p>

##<a id='understand-files'></a> Understand Installation and Product Template Files ##

During the installation process, Ops Manager combines information from the installation and product template files to generate the manifests that define your deployment. 

* **Installation file**: PCF stores user-entered data and automatically generated values for Ops Manager in an installation YAML file on the Ops Manager virtual machine (VM). PCF encrypts and stores this file in the directory `/var/tempest/workspaces/default`. You must decrypt this file to view the contents, edit them as necessary, then re-encrypt them.

* **Product templates**: Ops Manager uses product templates to create forms and obtain user input. The `job_types` and `property_blueprint` key-value pairs in a product template determine how the `jobs` and `properties` sections display in the installation file. Ops Manager stores product templates as YAML files in the directory `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata` on the Ops Manager VM. These files are not encrypted, so you can edit them without decrypting. User input does not alter these files.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Upgrading Ops Manager may eliminate your changes to the installation and product template files.</p>

##<a id='installation'></a> Modify the Installation File

Perform the following steps to locate, decrypt, and edit your Ops Manager installation file:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by following the steps in the [SSH into Ops Manager](trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of the _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ topic.
1. `cd` into the scripts directory:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd /home/tempest-web/tempest/web/scripts/
    </pre>
1. Run the following command to decrypt the installation YAML file and make a temporary copy of the decrypted file. When prompted for a passphrase, enter the decryption passphrase you created when you launched Ops Manager for the first time:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo -u tempest-web ./decrypt /var/tempest/workspaces/default/installation.yml /tmp/installation.yml
    </pre>
1. Open `/tmp/installation.yml` to view or edit values.
1. If you plan to make changes, make a backup of the original installation YAML file:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cp /var/tempest/workspaces/default/installation.yml ~/installation-orig.yml
    </pre>
1. If you have made changes to your copy of the installation YAML file, you must encrypt it and overwrite the original with it:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo -u tempest-web RAILS_ENV=production /home/tempest-web/tempest/web/scripts/encrypt /tmp/installation.yml /var/tempest/workspaces/default/installation.yml
    </pre>
    When prompted, enter a passphrase.
1. Delete the temporary copy of the decrypted file:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ rm /tmp/installation.yml
    </pre>
1. Restart the Ops Manager web interface:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo service tempest-web stop && sudo service tempest-web start
    </pre>
1. Navigate to Ops Manager in a browser and enter your decryption passphrase.
1. Log in to Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.
1. If Ops Manager cannot load your changes, see the [Revert To Your Backup](#revert) section of this topic to restore your previous settings.

##<a id='templates'></a> Modify Product Template Files

Perform the following steps to locate and edit your Ops Manager product template files:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by following the steps in the [SSH into Ops Manager](trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of the _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ topic.
1. On the Ops Manager VM, navigate to the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata` directory.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd /var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata
    </pre>
1. The `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata` directory contains the product templates as YAML files. If you plan to make changes, make a backup of the original product template YAML file:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cp /var/tempest/workspace/default/metadata/YOUR-PRODUCT-TEMPLATE.yml ~/YOUR-PRODUCT-TEMPLATE-orig.yml
    </pre>
1. Open and edit the product template YAML file as necessary. For more information about product templates, see the [Product Template Reference](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/product-template-reference.html) topic.
1. Navigate to Ops Manager to see your changes.
1. If Ops Manager cannot load your changes, see the [Revert To Your Backup](#revert) section of this to restore your previous settings.

##<a id='revert'></a> Revert to Your Backup

Perform the following steps to revert to your backup of an installation or product template file:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by following the steps in the [SSH into Ops Manager](trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of the _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ topic.
1. Overwrite the modified file with the backup:
    * For the installation file, run the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cp ~/installation-orig.yml /var/tempest/workspaces/default/installation.yml</pre>
    * For a product template file, run the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cp ~/YOUR-PRODUCT-TEMPLATE-orig.yml /var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata/YOUR-PRODUCT-TEMPLATE.yml</pre>
1. Restart the Ops Manager web interface:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo service tempest-web stop && sudo service tempest-web start
    </pre>
1. Navigate to Ops Manager in a browser and enter your decryption passphrase.
1. Log in to Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.
